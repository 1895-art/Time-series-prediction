# GBDT

## Introduction of GBDT
Gradient boosting decision tree is also the promising solutions for time series issues.

## Introduction of XGBoost
XGBoost is introduced in [XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754)

## Introduction of LightGBM
LightGBM is introduces in [LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf)

## Performance
GBDT could also be tuned into SOTA model in time series. I read some implementations of the competition to let me so sure that I'm not so good at tuning the parameters.
So I believe the performance here could be further optimized.
